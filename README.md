## About
This project is based on the work by [Joseph Gabay](https://twitter.com/stoppingcart?lang=en), his [original DEFCON talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBICDODmCPI) and  [Warshopping- Phreaking Smart Shopping Cart Wheels Through RF Sniffing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iprBprAFXCk&t=2s).

## How It Works
Most electronic shopping cart wheels listen for a 7.8 kHz signal from an underground wire to know when to lock and unlock. A management remote can send a different signal at 7.8 kHz to the wheel to unlock it. Since 7.8 kHz is in the audio range, you can use the parasitic EMF from your phone's speaker to "transmit" a similar code by playing a crafted audio file.
## How To Use
Before using disconnect any headphones you are using. Hold watch next to cart wheel and press desired command. Command sound will begin play. Wait for sound to finish playing and command should have been successfully sent.

There is no need to change sound settings. App will automatically adjust volume to full to play command then return to previous setting.
